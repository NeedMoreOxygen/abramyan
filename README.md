# JavaScript Algorithmic Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to various algorithmic exercises, focusing on the fundamentals of the **JavaScript programming language**. Each exercise explores core concepts, from basic data types to control structures and arrays, providing a strong foundation for programming logic.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **begin**
   - Introductory exercises for getting started with JavaScript.
   - Covers basic syntax, statements, and code structure.

### 2. **Integer**
   - Exercises involving integer manipulation, arithmetic operations, and number theory fundamentals.

### 3. **Boolean**
   - Logical operations and boolean expressions.
   - Practice with truth tables, conditions, and logical operators.

### 4. **IF**
   - Focuses on conditional statements.
   - Solving problems using `if` and `else` statements for decision-making.

### 5. **Case**
   - Explores the use of `switch` statements.
   - Exercises to choose between multiple options effectively.

### 6. **while**
   - Looping constructs using `while` loops.
   - Focus on repetitive tasks and managing loop conditions.

### 7. **For**
   - Exercises using `for` loops for iteration.
   - Includes nested loops and common algorithmic patterns.

### 8. **array**
   - Working with arrays, including:
     - Indexing
     - Iteration
     - Common operations like sorting, filtering, and mapping.
